	Most of the functionalities in the scrabble game work properly, such as the letter tiles being able to be dragged and dropped onto target Scrabble squares. The program correcetly identifies which letter tile is dropped in the gameboard. The board has two fully functioning bonus squares, and the game correctly tallies the points up. The game is able to be played as long as the user likes to play. Three buttons work to help the game play, a reset button to restart the game, a clear button which clears the board of any tiles and places the existing tiles all back to the rack keeping the status you have currently, and the check word button. The check word button works properly as well, it makes sure the word is longer than 1 character than checks to see if it is a word (dictionary not implemented so no conditions for a word), then it adds the potential points from that word to your total points display, and this is kept track of till you stop playing. After playing a word and pressing the check word button, only the number of letter tiles needed to bring the player’s “hand” back to 7 tiles are generated back (new tiles to keep the game going). Tiles can be dropped in the board and back to the rack as intended. The board is cleared after each round so that a new word can be played. 	A few functionalities need work such as the functionality that spaces arent displayed when there are tiles missing inbetween letters. Finally, there is no dictionary implemented so it doesnt check for real words (however, this is bonus points).
